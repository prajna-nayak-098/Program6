6. Remove Friends
After getting her PhD, Christie has become a celebrity at her university, and her
Facebook profile is full of friend requests. Being the nice girl, she is, Christie has
accepted all the requests.
Now Kuldeep is jealous of all the attention she is getting from other guys, so he asks
her to delete some of the guys from her friend list.
To avoid a 'scene', Christie decides to remove some friends from her friend list, since
she knows the popularity of each of the friend she has, she uses the following
algorithm to delete a friend.
Algorithm Delete(Friend):
DeleteFriend=false
for i = 1 to Friend.length-1
if (Friend[i].popularity < Friend[i+1].popularity)
delete i th friend
DeleteFriend=true
break
if(DeleteFriend == false)
delete the last friend.
Input Format
First line contains T number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N, the
number of friends Christie currently has and K ,the number of friends Christie decides
to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space.
Output Format
For each test case print N-K numbers which represent popularity of Christie friend's
after deleting K friends.
